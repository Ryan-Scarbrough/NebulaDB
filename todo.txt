General:
- UI on Mac is kinda buggy with things flashing in and out. Find way to mitigate
- find less jank way to do paths in the project
- Make a way to change the path of the shard

UI:
- Clean up UI in the add database window

Frames:
- fix current_dir stuff in database_frame

Databases:
- use better way to treat spaces as literal for paths (raw strings?)
- check ports before starting servers
- make sure mongodb is installed before attempting to run any of the servers

BUGS:
- when you click away from database frame to another frame and then go back to the database frame,
you have to click three times before everything shows up
- on windows, the color behind the image of the nebula isnt the same color as the rest of the window
