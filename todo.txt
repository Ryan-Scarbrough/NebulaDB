Frames:
- fix current_dir stuff in database_frame

Databases:
- use better way to treat spaces as literal for paths (raw strings?)
- instead of trying to connect to a db to check if it's alive, just ping it

BUGS:
- when you click away from database frame to another frame and then go back to the database frame,
you have to click three times before everything shows up
