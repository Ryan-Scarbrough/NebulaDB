General:
- UI on Mac is kinda buggy with things flashing in and out. Find way to mitigate

Frames:
- fix current_dir stuff in database_frame

Databases:
- use better way to treat spaces as literal for paths (raw strings?)
- check ports before starting servers
- make sure mongodb is installed before attempting to run any of the servers

BUGS:
- when you click away from database frame to another frame and then go back to the database frame,
you have to click three times before everything shows up
